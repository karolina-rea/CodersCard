  My passion for human psyche, gathering knowledge and technology has led me to
  study the first one and pursue the rest in my free time. I am currently
  studying two specializations of psychology in extramural mode. I am actively
  striving for comprehensive development. I have well-developed soft skills,
  especially resistance to stress, good work organization and creativity. 


  I value communication and cheerfulness at work, which I care for in contact with others - work ethic is extremely important to me. I value professional communication, try to learn as much as possible from my colleagues and I am happy to share my knowledge with others.


  I am a very cheerful, social, ambitious, and active person, who likes to travel, meet different people, act for the benefit of society and learn new skills.
